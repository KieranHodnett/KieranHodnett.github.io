I'm a published writer exploring the intersections of technology, identity, and human connection through fiction and literary journalism. My work examines how modern life shapes our relationships with ourselves and each other, often through the lens of coming-of-age experiences and family dynamics.

### Poetry

My poetry explores themes of memory, relationships, and the tension between isolation and connection. Working primarily in traditional forms like villanelles and sonnets, I'm drawn to how formal constraints can intensify emotional expression.

**Sample Poem - "Magdalena"**

*I miss you always; already today,*  
*Holding a heart in our hands with a pinch,*   
*I joyed in watching you walk Santa Fe.*

*Revving the engine, our muscles engaged*  
*Lost in a way on that tumbling old bench*  
*I miss you always; already today.*

*Traversing all distance; patience unscathed,*   
*Were it that miles could turn to an inch,*   
*I joyed in watching you walk Santa Fe.*

*Inverting the sky we made blue out of gray,*  
*Tightening my world with an artful wrench,*  
*I miss you always; already today.*

*Smiling wider than spaces we've strayed,*  
*No unit measures a hope so well drenched,*  
*I joyed in watching you walk Santa Fe.*

*Another weekend; a soulful array,*   
*Machines once heavy appear now a finch*  
*I joyed in watching you walk Santa Fe,*   
*Though I miss you always; already today.*

## Current Project: Novel in Progress

I'm currently working on a coming-of-age novel that explores themes of:

**Family Dynamics and Generational Tension**  
The story examines how technology and social change create gaps between parents and children, while also revealing the enduring bonds that transcend these differences. The narrative explores how families navigate moments of transition and growth.

**The Weight of Expectation**  
Characters grapple with the pressure to fulfill both their own dreams and the aspirations others have placed upon them. The novel investigates how young people balance personal ambition with family loyalty and social expectations.

**First Experiences and Lost Innocence**  
Through pivotal moments and unexpected encounters, characters confront the complexity of the adult world. The story captures that liminal space between adolescence and adulthood where every experience carries heightened significance.

**Technology and Human Connection**  
Set against the backdrop of our digitally connected yet emotionally fragmented world, the novel explores how technology both enables and complicates genuine human relationships.

**The Search for Authentic Voice**  
Central to the narrative is a young protagonist's struggle to find his artistic voice while navigating the competing influences of family, society, and his own ambitions. The story examines the courage required to speak one's truth.

## Writing Style and Influences

**Fiction**: My prose tends toward character-driven narratives that prioritize psychological depth over plot mechanics. I'm drawn to realistic dialogue that captures the rhythms and tensions of family relationships, detailed observation of everyday moments that reveal larger truths about human nature, and social commentary woven naturally into personal stories.

**Poetry**: I work primarily in traditional forms—villanelles, sonnets, and ghazals—finding that formal constraints often intensify emotional expression. My poems explore themes of longing, memory, and the spaces between people, often focusing on how distance (physical, emotional, temporal) shapes our relationships.

I'm influenced by writers who master the art of finding the extraordinary within the ordinary—authors who can make a car ride or a family dinner carry the weight of larger human truths.

## Literary Interests

**Contemporary Fiction**: Particularly drawn to stories that examine how technology and social change impact personal relationships and family structures.

**Character Studies**: Interested in the internal lives of characters facing moments of transition, growth, or moral complexity.

**Social Realism**: Exploring how broader cultural forces shape individual experiences and choices.

**Generational Narratives**: Stories that examine the tensions and connections between different generations within families and communities.

## Writing Philosophy

I believe great fiction emerges from careful observation of how people actually speak, think, and interact with each other. The most powerful stories often arise from seemingly mundane moments—a conversation in a car, a family dinner, an unexpected encounter—that reveal the deeper currents running through our lives.

My goal as a writer is to create characters who feel authentically human: flawed, complex, and struggling to understand themselves and their place in the world. I'm particularly interested in capturing the voice of young people coming of age in our current cultural moment, with all its unique challenges and opportunities.
