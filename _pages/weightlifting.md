I'm passionate about strength training with a primary focus on powerlifting, where I dedicate most of my training time to perfecting the three main lifts: deadlift, bench press, and squat. The discipline and progressive nature of powerlifting appeals to my goal-oriented mindset, and I enjoy the technical aspects of optimizing form and programming.

## Personal Records

**Deadlift:** 475 lbs  
**Bench Press:** 255 lbs  
**Squat:** 385 lbs  

These numbers represent years of consistent training, learning proper technique, and gradually building strength while prioritizing injury prevention and long-term progress.

## Training Philosophy

My approach to powerlifting emphasizes:

**Progressive Overload**: Gradually increasing weight, volume, or intensity over time to drive consistent strength gains.

**Technical Proficiency**: Focusing on proper form and movement patterns before adding weight. Each lift is a skill that requires constant refinement.

**Recovery and Sustainability**: Understanding that strength is built during recovery, not just in the gym. I prioritize sleep, nutrition, and managing training stress.

**Consistency Over Intensity**: Regular, consistent training sessions trump sporadic high-intensity efforts. Building strength is a marathon, not a sprint.

## Amateur Personal Training

Beyond my own training, I dabble in amateur personal training, helping friends and acquaintances with their fitness goals. While I'm not a certified trainer, I enjoy sharing knowledge about:

- Basic movement patterns and exercise selection
- Progressive programming principles
- Form coaching for compound movements
- Goal setting and motivation strategies

I find it rewarding to help others discover their own strength and build confidence in the gym. There's something special about witnessing someone hit a personal record or overcome a movement they initially found intimidating.

## The Mental Game

Powerlifting has taught me valuable lessons that extend beyond the gym. The sport demands patience, consistency, and the ability to work toward long-term goals while managing setbacks and plateaus. These skills translate directly to other areas of life, including my professional work and creative pursuits.

The mental aspect of approaching a heavy lift—the focus, preparation, and commitment required in that moment—has helped me develop confidence and resilience that I carry into other challenges.

## Community and Growth

The powerlifting community has been incredibly welcoming and supportive. I've learned as much from training partners and fellow lifters as I have from any program or book. The shared pursuit of strength creates bonds and friendships that extend well beyond the gym.

I'm always looking to learn and improve, whether that's refining technique, trying new programming approaches, or better understanding the science behind strength training. The journey of getting stronger never really ends—there's always another goal to work toward.
