I'm an actor with experience in both classical and contemporary theater, currently seeking new performance opportunities. I'm drawn to complex characters and enjoy the collaborative nature of bringing stories to life on stage.

## Selected Roles

**Petruchio** - *The Taming of the Shrew* by William Shakespeare  
Playing Shakespeare's controversial male lead taught me to find the humanity and complexity within characters who could easily become one-dimensional. Petruchio demands both physical comedy skills and the ability to navigate the play's challenging themes with nuance and intelligence.

**Newton** - *Die Physiker* by Friedrich DÃ¼rrenmatt  
This thought-provoking drama about physicists in a mental institution allowed me to explore the intersection of science, madness, and moral responsibility. Newton requires both intellectual precision and emotional vulnerability, balancing the character's scientific brilliance with his psychological fragility.

**Harry Crocker** - *Lalita and the Tramp*  
This original production, which premiered at the New York Theater Festival, gave me the opportunity to work alongside the iconic figure of Charlie Chaplin in a friend's creative interpretation. The role required physical comedy skills and the ability to support the central narrative while creating a distinct character presence.

## Training and Approach

My approach to acting emphasizes:

**Character Development**: I believe in thorough character research and finding authentic motivations that drive every choice on stage.

**Physical Expression**: Whether it's period movement, physical comedy, or contemporary realism, I work to ensure my body language serves the story.

**Collaborative Spirit**: Theater is a team effort, and I value directors, fellow actors, and designers who push each other toward the best possible production.

**Versatility**: From Shakespeare's heightened language to contemporary drama, I enjoy adapting my performance style to serve different theatrical genres and periods.

## Currently Seeking

I'm actively looking for new acting opportunities, including:

- Theater productions (both classical and contemporary)
- Independent film projects
- Experimental or devised work
- Collaborative projects with emerging artists

I'm particularly interested in work that challenges audiences and explores complex themes, whether through established scripts or original material.

## Skills and Experience

**Stage Combat**: Basic training in theatrical fighting
**Accents and Dialects**: Experience with British RP, various American regional dialects, German speaking 
**Movement**: Physical theater, period movement, basic dance
**Voice**: Classical text work, projection, breath control
**Improvisation**: Collaborative scene building, character development

## Philosophy

Acting, for me, is about truth-telling through the vessel of character. Whether I'm embodying a Shakespearean protagonist or a contemporary figure, my goal is to find the authentic human experience within the role and share that honestly with the audience.

I believe theater has the power to challenge, comfort, and transform both performers and audiences. Every production is an opportunity to explore what it means to be human and to create moments of genuine connection in an increasingly fragmented world.
